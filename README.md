Instead, create a .env file in your project directory with the following content:EMAIL_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com SMTP_PORT=587Important Security Note: Use Gmail App Passwords instead of your regular Gmail password. To set this up, go to your Google Account settings, enable two-factor authentication, then generate an App Password specifically for this application. Use that 16-character password in your .env file.Never commit your .env file to GitHub or share it publicly as it contains sensitive information.How It WorksMain MenuWhen you start the application, you'll see a clean menu with options to:Add new reminders to your system View all your current reminders in a beautiful table format Delete reminders you no longer need Execute the reminder system to start monitoring and sending notificationsReminder List DisplayThe application displays your reminders in a beautiful, color-coded table showing:Email address where notifications will be sent Unique ID for each reminder Message describing what the reminder is for Time when the reminder will trigger (shown in human-friendly format) Priority level with color coding and icons Category with appropriate icons Repeat status showing whether it's a one-time or recurring reminderTechnical FeaturesNatural Language Processing: Uses the dateparser library to understand human-friendly time expressions like "tomorrow at 3pm" or "in 2 hours"Email Integration: Connects to Gmail's SMTP server to send professional-looking email notificationsScheduling Engine: Uses the schedule library to manage both one-time and recurring reminders efficientlyRich Terminal Interface: Creates beautiful, colorful displays using the rich library for better user experienceJSON Data Persistence: Stores all reminder data in a local JSON file so your reminders persist between application restartsError Handling: Includes comprehensive error checking and user-friendly error messagesInput Validation: Validates user input to ensure reminders are created correctlyProject StructureRemind.py - Contains the core reminder logic including email sending, reminder execution, and data management functionsmain.py - Provides the command-line interface and handles user interactionsReminder folder - Directory where reminder data is stored in JSON format.env - Environment file containing email credentials (not included in repository for security)README.md - This documentation fileFuture EnhancementsGraphical User Interface - Add a web-based or desktop GUI for easier interactionMultiple Email Providers - Support for other email services beyond GmailSMS Notifications - Add text message notifications as an alternative to emailCalendar Integration - Sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, or other calendar applicationsCloud Synchronization - Store reminders in the cloud for access across multiple devicesMobile Application - Create a smartphone app versionTeam Reminders - Allow sharing reminders with family members or work teamsContributingIf you'd like to contribute to this project:Fork the repository on GitHub Create a feature branch for your changes Make your improvements with clear, descriptive commit messages Test your changes thoroughly Push your changes to your forked repository Open a Pull Request with a detailed description of your improvementsLicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License, which means you're free to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as you include the original copyright notice.Author[Dev-Paul-01] - Full Stack DeveloperGitHub: @Dev-Paul-01 Email: oluwaseyiogunsola90@gmail.comLinked
